# BROKEN STUFF #

## Bad bugs, fixes likely easy ##

- webOS photos have TIFF timestamp only, which getphoto-osx doesn't look for
- 275 pictures makes too long of URL to download exporter (need to POST instead)
- trouble exporting basket named "Italy ✈"
- baskets swap positions when adding photos (easy to add into wrong one)
- moving mouse cursor when previewing a photo ends up selecting/dragging its thumbnail


## Moderate pain and/or moderate difficulty to fix ##

- import/export progress is barely implemented
- installation process is painful
- photos along edge cut off when previewed
- photos selected when just previewing
- holes left when removing photos from basket
- pagination is super frustrating


## Tougher usability/optimization issues or nits with simple workarounds ##

- import is slow when thousands already imported (use folder last-modifieds?)
- movies (well, *.thm) imported, perhaps need ignored files and extensions per-source? (see above)
- export utility ends up as "left over" file, making user garbage collect
- exported originals should get file mod date set to timestamp

- not intuitive how to unshow selected basket (only by clicking its name again)
- you have to select photos multiple times to add to multiple baskets
- adding to basket click feels kinda hard sometimes (Fitt's law yadda yadda)
- no indication of how many photos are in a basket


## Ponies ##

- reorder photos in basket (manual and by date)
- dashboard could be more useful (stats, sparklines, etc.)
- single photo mode with prev/next might be nice (different app?)
- geotagging (separate app)
- direct Flickr/etc. integration (upload, sync metadata...)
